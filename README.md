**Bookstore Management System** 

**Introduction**<br>
This project implements a 3-tier architecture Inventory Management System designed specifically for bookstores. Developed using C# and the .NET framework, the system promotes modularity and maintainability through separation of concerns.


**Architecture**<br>
The system adheres to a 3-tier architecture, consisting of:<br>
Presentation Layer (PL): Handles user interaction and visual presentation of data.<br>
Business Logic Layer (BLL): Implements core business functionalities like order management and inventory control.<br>
Data Access Layer (DAL): Manages interaction with the data storage mechanism (e.g., database).<br>
This separation facilitates independent development and maintenance of each layer, enhancing overall system flexibility.<br>


**Features**<br>
Manager Section:<br>
Inventory & Order Management: Manage book stock, and track order fulfillment.<br>
Order Tracking Simulator: Simulate the order fulfillment process for testing and training purposes.<brr>

Customer Section:<br>
Book Ordering: Customers can browse and order books from the bookstore's inventory.<br>
Order Tracking: Customers can track the shipping status of their orders.<br>
